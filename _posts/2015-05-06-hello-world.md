So, this blog is called the “The Strange Wonders of this developer's Cosmos”. A little bit lame you say?! Maybe.. But truly, the Programming World is filled with strange(some times even insane!!) behaviors that begin outstanding quests just to figure out what the problem is.

This blog won’t be filled with “everyday tutorials”, those you can find with just a couple of clicks on Google from other developers that did a great job.

This blog will try to show those strange situations that, as a Mobile Developer, I’ve found in my daily work. Situations that took me a while to figure out the solutions and that sometimes left me WTF (Well, That’s Fantastic :P). Although the solution may not the best sometimes, it was the one that I used, and that I expect that will help other developers.

See you soon!
